assignment number: 1

I get some help from Kadir Yanik about code readability.
I did it in one day but later i did some bug fixes, readability improvements.

I practised well while doing it but i think this assignment isn't a good one for function practising. 
I think there is no need for extra functions for that kind of problem. Input type is very exact.
I would like to think only about algorithm.

Known bugs: 
As i know, program has no bugs. 
There is a case that there is no solution. I handled this case.
